## Running Tests

During testing a bug was apparant. On testing code only 5 available emoji pairs were displaying. On reviewing code it was apparant that I had not added the generated HTML code to the page and had created the HTML structure as a string, but had not appended it to the DOM. The fix applied was modyfing the `generateGame` function to apped the generated HTML to the `boardContainer` element.
There was also an apparant issue with the const pickRandom function and an update was required to ensure that the `pick` array will always contain the required number of unquie emojis which results in the correct number of cards being generated.
